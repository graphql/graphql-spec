GraphQL
-------

*Working Draft - October 2016*

**Introduction**

This is a Draft RFC Specification for GraphQL, a query language created by
Facebook in 2012 for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models
for client-server applications. The development of this standard started
in 2015. GraphQL is a new and evolving language and is not complete. Significant
enhancement will continue in future editions of this specification.
