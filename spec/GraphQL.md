# GraphQL

_September 2025 Edition_

**Introduction**

This is the specification for GraphQL, a query language and execution engine for
describing and performing the capabilities and requirements of data models for
client-server applications.

A conforming implementation of GraphQL must fulfill all normative requirements
described in this specification (see [Conformance](#sec-Appendix-Conformance)).
The GraphQL specification is provided under the OWFa 1.0 license (see
[Copyright and Licensing](#sec-Appendix-Copyright-and-Licensing)).

GraphQL was originally created in 2012 and the development of this open standard
started in 2015. It is a deliverable of the
[GraphQL Specification Project](https://graphql.org/community/), established in
2019 with the [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org/).

The [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphql.org/foundation/) was formed in 2019 as
a neutral focal point for organizations who support development of the GraphQL
ecosystem. If your organization benefits from GraphQL, please consider

This specification is developed on GitHub at
[graphql/graphql-spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/). Contributions
are managed by the
[GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg), hosted by the
[GraphQL Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md).

[contribution guide](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

GraphQL has evolved and may continue to evolve in future editions of this
specification. Previous editions of the GraphQL specification can be found at
permalinks that match their
[release tag](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/releases). The latest
working draft release can be found at
[https://spec.graphql.org/draft](https://spec.graphql.org/draft).
