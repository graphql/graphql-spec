# Validation

A GraphQL service does not just verify if a request is syntactically correct,
but also ensures that it is unambiguous and mistake-free in the context of a
given GraphQL schema.

An invalid request is still technically executable, and will always produce a
stable result as defined by the algorithms in the Execution section, however
that result may be ambiguous, surprising, or unexpected relative to a request
containing validation errors, so execution should only occur for valid requests.

Typically validation is performed in the context of a request immediately before
execution, however a GraphQL service may execute a request without explicitly
validating it if that exact same request is known to have been validated before.
For example: the request may be validated during development, provided it does
not later change, or a service may validate a request once and memoize the
result to avoid validating the same request again in the future. Any client-side
or development-time tool should report validation errors and not allow the
formulation or execution of requests known to be invalid at that given point in
time.

**Type System Evolution**

As GraphQL type system schema evolves over time by adding new types and new
fields, it is possible that a request which was previously valid could later
become invalid. Any change that can cause a previously valid request to become
invalid is considered a _breaking change_. GraphQL services and schema
maintainers are encouraged to avoid breaking changes, however in order to be
more resilient to these breaking changes, sophisticated GraphQL systems may
still allow for the execution of requests which _at some point_ were known to be
free of any validation errors, and have not changed since.

**Examples**

For this section of this schema, we will assume the following type system in
order to demonstrate examples:

```graphql example
type Query {
  dog: Dog
  findDog(searchBy: FindDogInput): Dog
}

enum DogCommand {
  SIT
  DOWN
  HEEL
}

type Dog implements Pet {
  name: String!
  nickname: String
  barkVolume: Int
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: DogCommand!): Boolean!
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: Boolean): Boolean!
  owner: Human
}

interface Sentient {
  name: String!
}

interface Pet {
  name: String!
}

type Alien implements Sentient {
  name: String!
  homePlanet: String
}

type Human implements Sentient {
  name: String!
  pets: [Pet!]
}

enum CatCommand {
  JUMP
}

type Cat implements Pet {
  name: String!
  nickname: String
  doesKnowCommand(catCommand: CatCommand!): Boolean!
  meowVolume: Int
}

union CatOrDog = Cat | Dog
union DogOrHuman = Dog | Human
union HumanOrAlien = Human | Alien

input FindDogInput {
  name: String
  owner: String
}
```

## Documents

### Executable Definitions

**Formal Specification**

- For each definition {definition} in the document:
  - {definition} must be {ExecutableDefinition} (it must not be
    {TypeSystemDefinitionOrExtension}).

**Explanatory Text**

GraphQL execution will only consider the executable definitions Operation and
Fragment. Type system definitions and extensions are not executable, and are not
considered during execution.

To avoid ambiguity, a document containing {TypeSystemDefinitionOrExtension} is
invalid for execution.

GraphQL documents not intended to be directly executed may include
{TypeSystemDefinitionOrExtension}.

For example, the following document is invalid for execution since the original
executing schema may not know about the provided type extension:

```graphql counter-example
query getDogName {
  dog {
    name
    color
  }
}

extend type Dog {
  color: String
}
```

## Operations

### Named Operation Definitions

#### Operation Name Uniqueness

**Formal Specification**

- For each operation definition {operation} in the document:
  - Let {operationName} be the name of {operation}.
  - If {operationName} exists:
    - Let {operations} be all operation definitions in the document named
      {operationName}.
    - {operations} must be a set of one.

**Explanatory Text**

Each named operation definition must be unique within a document when referred
to by its name.

For example the following document is valid:

```graphql example
query getDogName {
  dog {
    name
  }
}

query getOwnerName {
  dog {
    owner {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

While this document is invalid:

```graphql counter-example
query getName {
  dog {
    name
  }
}

query getName {
  dog {
    owner {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

It is invalid even if the type of each operation is different:

```graphql counter-example
query dogOperation {
  dog {
    name
  }
}

mutation dogOperation {
  mutateDog {
    id
  }
}
```

### Anonymous Operation Definitions

#### Lone Anonymous Operation

**Formal Specification**

- Let {operations} be all operation definitions in the document.
- Let {anonymous} be all anonymous operation definitions in the document.
- If {operations} is a set of more than 1:
  - {anonymous} must be empty.

**Explanatory Text**

GraphQL allows a short-hand form for defining query operations when only that
one operation exists in the document.

For example the following document is valid:

```graphql example
{
  dog {
    name
  }
}
```

While this document is invalid:

```graphql counter-example
{
  dog {
    name
  }
}

query getName {
  dog {
    owner {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscription Operation Definitions

#### Single Root Field

**Formal Specification**

- Let {subscriptionType} be the root Subscription type in {schema}.
- For each subscription operation definition {subscription} in the document:
  - Let {selectionSet} be the top level selection set on {subscription}.
  - Let {variableValues} be the empty set.
  - Let {groupedFieldSet} be the result of {CollectFields(subscriptionType,
    selectionSet, variableValues)}.
  - {groupedFieldSet} must have exactly one entry, which must not be an
    introspection field.

**Explanatory Text**

Subscription operations must have exactly one root field.

Valid examples:

```graphql example
subscription sub {
  newMessage {
    body
    sender
  }
}
```

```graphql example
subscription sub {
  ...newMessageFields
}

fragment newMessageFields on Subscription {
  newMessage {
    body
    sender
  }
}
```

Invalid:

```graphql counter-example
subscription sub {
  newMessage {
    body
    sender
  }
  disallowedSecondRootField
}
```

```graphql counter-example
subscription sub {
  ...multipleSubscriptions
}

fragment multipleSubscriptions on Subscription {
  newMessage {
    body
    sender
  }
  disallowedSecondRootField
}
```

The root field of a subscription operation must not be an introspection field.
The following example is also invalid:

```graphql counter-example
subscription sub {
  __typename
}
```

Note: While each subscription must have exactly one root field, a document may
contain any number of operations, each of which may contain different root
fields. When executed, a document containing multiple subscription operations
must provide the operation name as described in {GetOperation()}.

## Fields

### Field Selections

Field selections must exist on Object, Interface, and Union types.

**Formal Specification**

- For each {selection} in the document:
  - Let {fieldName} be the target field of {selection}.
  - {fieldName} must be defined on type in scope.

**Explanatory Text**

The target field of a field selection must be defined on the scoped type of the
selection set. There are no limitations on alias names.

For example the following fragment would not pass validation:

```graphql counter-example
fragment fieldNotDefined on Dog {
  meowVolume
}

fragment aliasedLyingFieldTargetNotDefined on Dog {
  barkVolume: kawVolume
}
```

For interfaces, direct field selection can only be done on fields. Fields of
concrete implementors are not relevant to the validity of the given
interface-typed selection set.

For example, the following is valid:

```graphql example
fragment interfaceFieldSelection on Pet {
  name
}
```

and the following is invalid:

```graphql counter-example
fragment definedOnImplementorsButNotInterface on Pet {
  nickname
}
```

Because unions do not define fields, fields may not be directly selected from a
union-typed selection set, with the exception of the meta-field {\_\_typename}.
Fields from a union-typed selection set must only be queried indirectly via a
fragment.

For example the following is valid:

```graphql example
fragment inDirectFieldSelectionOnUnion on CatOrDog {
  __typename
  ... on Pet {
    name
  }
  ... on Dog {
    barkVolume
  }
}
```

But the following is invalid:

```graphql counter-example
fragment directFieldSelectionOnUnion on CatOrDog {
  name
  barkVolume
}
```

### Field Selection Merging

**Formal Specification**

- Let {set} be any selection set defined in the GraphQL document.
- {FieldsInSetCanMerge(set)} must be true.

FieldsInSetCanMerge(set):

- Let {fieldsForName} be the set of selections with a given response name in
  {set} including visiting fragments and inline fragments.
- Given each pair of members {fieldA} and {fieldB} in {fieldsForName}:
  - {SameResponseShape(fieldA, fieldB)} must be true.
  - If the parent types of {fieldA} and {fieldB} are equal or if either is not
    an Object Type:
    - {fieldA} and {fieldB} must have identical field names.
    - {fieldA} and {fieldB} must have identical sets of arguments.
    - Let {mergedSet} be the result of adding the selection set of {fieldA} and
      the selection set of {fieldB}.
    - {FieldsInSetCanMerge(mergedSet)} must be true.

SameResponseShape(fieldA, fieldB):

- Let {typeA} be the return type of {fieldA}.
- Let {typeB} be the return type of {fieldB}.
- If {typeA} or {typeB} is Non-Null:
  - If {typeA} or {typeB} is nullable, return false.
  - Let {typeA} be the nullable type of {typeA}.
  - Let {typeB} be the nullable type of {typeB}.
- If {typeA} or {typeB} is List:
  - If {typeA} or {typeB} is not List, return false.
  - Let {typeA} be the item type of {typeA}.
  - Let {typeB} be the item type of {typeB}.
  - Repeat from step 3.
- If {typeA} or {typeB} is Scalar or Enum:
  - If {typeA} and {typeB} are the same type return true, otherwise return
    false.
- Assert: {typeA} and {typeB} are both composite types.
- Let {mergedSet} be the result of adding the selection set of {fieldA} and the
  selection set of {fieldB}.
- Let {fieldsForName} be the set of selections with a given response name in
  {mergedSet} including visiting fragments and inline fragments.
- Given each pair of members {subfieldA} and {subfieldB} in {fieldsForName}:
  - If {SameResponseShape(subfieldA, subfieldB)} is false, return false.
- Return true.

**Explanatory Text**

If multiple field selections with the same response names are encountered during
execution, the field and arguments to execute and the resulting value should be
unambiguous. Therefore any two field selections which might both be encountered
for the same object are only valid if they are equivalent.

During execution, the simultaneous execution of fields with the same response
name is accomplished by {MergeSelectionSets()} and {CollectFields()}.

For simple hand-written GraphQL, this rule is obviously a clear developer error,
however nested fragments can make this difficult to detect manually.

The following selections correctly merge:

```graphql example
fragment mergeIdenticalFields on Dog {
  name
  name
}

fragment mergeIdenticalAliasesAndFields on Dog {
  otherName: name
  otherName: name
}
```

The following is not able to merge:

```graphql counter-example
fragment conflictingBecauseAlias on Dog {
  name: nickname
  name
}
```

Identical fields are also merged if they have identical arguments. Both values
and variables can be correctly merged.

For example the following correctly merge:

```graphql example
fragment mergeIdenticalFieldsWithIdenticalArgs on Dog {
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: SIT)
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: SIT)
}

fragment mergeIdenticalFieldsWithIdenticalValues on Dog {
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: $dogCommand)
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: $dogCommand)
}
```

The following do not correctly merge:

```graphql counter-example
fragment conflictingArgsOnValues on Dog {
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: SIT)
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: HEEL)
}

fragment conflictingArgsValueAndVar on Dog {
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: SIT)
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: $dogCommand)
}

fragment conflictingArgsWithVars on Dog {
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: $varOne)
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: $varTwo)
}

fragment differingArgs on Dog {
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: SIT)
  doesKnowCommand
}
```

The following fields would not merge together, however both cannot be
encountered against the same object, so they are safe:

```graphql example
fragment safeDifferingFields on Pet {
  ... on Dog {
    volume: barkVolume
  }
  ... on Cat {
    volume: meowVolume
  }
}

fragment safeDifferingArgs on Pet {
  ... on Dog {
    doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: SIT)
  }
  ... on Cat {
    doesKnowCommand(catCommand: JUMP)
  }
}
```

However, the field responses must be shapes which can be merged. For example,
leaf types must not differ. In this example, `someValue` might be a `String` or
an `Int`:

```graphql counter-example
fragment conflictingDifferingResponses on Pet {
  ... on Dog {
    someValue: nickname
  }
  ... on Cat {
    someValue: meowVolume
  }
}
```

### Leaf Field Selections

**Formal Specification**

- For each {selection} in the document:
  - Let {selectionType} be the unwrapped result type of {selection}.
  - If {selectionType} is a scalar or enum:
    - The subselection set of that selection must be empty.
  - If {selectionType} is an interface, union, or object:
    - The subselection set of that selection must not be empty.

**Explanatory Text**

A field subselection is not allowed on leaf fields. A leaf field is any field
with a scalar or enum unwrapped type.

The following is valid.

```graphql example
fragment scalarSelection on Dog {
  barkVolume
}
```

The following is invalid.

```graphql counter-example
fragment scalarSelectionsNotAllowedOnInt on Dog {
  barkVolume {
    sinceWhen
  }
}
```

Conversely, non-leaf fields must have a field subselection. A non-leaf field is
any field with an object, interface, or union unwrapped type.

Let's assume the following additions to the query root operation type of the
schema:

```graphql example
extend type Query {
  human: Human
  pet: Pet
  catOrDog: CatOrDog
}
```

The following examples are invalid because they include non-leaf fields without
a field subselection.

```graphql counter-example
query directQueryOnObjectWithoutSubFields {
  human
}

query directQueryOnInterfaceWithoutSubFields {
  pet
}

query directQueryOnUnionWithoutSubFields {
  catOrDog
}
```

However the following example is valid since it includes a field subselection.

```graphql example
query directQueryOnObjectWithSubFields {
  human {
    name
  }
}
```

## Arguments

Arguments are provided to both fields and directives. The following validation
rules apply in both cases.

### Argument Names

**Formal Specification**

- For each {argument} in the document:
  - Let {argumentName} be the Name of {argument}.
  - Let {argumentDefinition} be the argument definition provided by the parent
    field or definition named {argumentName}.
  - {argumentDefinition} must exist.

**Explanatory Text**

Every argument provided to a field or directive must be defined in the set of
possible arguments of that field or directive.

For example the following are valid:

```graphql example
fragment argOnRequiredArg on Dog {
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: SIT)
}

fragment argOnOptional on Dog {
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: true) @include(if: true)
}
```

the following is invalid since `command` is not defined on `DogCommand`.

```graphql counter-example
fragment invalidArgName on Dog {
  doesKnowCommand(command: CLEAN_UP_HOUSE)
}
```

and this is also invalid as `unless` is not defined on `@include`.

```graphql counter-example
fragment invalidArgName on Dog {
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: true) @include(unless: false)
}
```

In order to explore more complicated argument examples, let's add the following
to our type system:

```graphql example
type Arguments {
  multipleRequirements(x: Int!, y: Int!): Int!
  booleanArgField(booleanArg: Boolean): Boolean
  floatArgField(floatArg: Float): Float
  intArgField(intArg: Int): Int
  nonNullBooleanArgField(nonNullBooleanArg: Boolean!): Boolean!
  booleanListArgField(booleanListArg: [Boolean]!): [Boolean]
  optionalNonNullBooleanArgField(optionalBooleanArg: Boolean! = false): Boolean!
}

extend type Query {
  arguments: Arguments
}
```

Order does not matter in arguments. Therefore both the following examples are
valid.

```graphql example
fragment multipleArgs on Arguments {
  multipleRequirements(x: 1, y: 2)
}

fragment multipleArgsReverseOrder on Arguments {
  multipleRequirements(y: 2, x: 1)
}
```

### Argument Uniqueness

Fields and directives treat arguments as a mapping of argument name to value.
More than one argument with the same name in an argument set is ambiguous and
invalid.

**Formal Specification**

- For each {argument} in the Document:
  - Let {argumentName} be the Name of {argument}.
  - Let {arguments} be all Arguments named {argumentName} in the Argument Set
    which contains {argument}.
  - {arguments} must be the set containing only {argument}.

#### Required Arguments

- For each Field or Directive in the document:
  - Let {arguments} be the arguments provided by the Field or Directive.
  - Let {argumentDefinitions} be the set of argument definitions of that Field
    or Directive.
  - For each {argumentDefinition} in {argumentDefinitions}:
    - Let {type} be the expected type of {argumentDefinition}.
    - Let {defaultValue} be the default value of {argumentDefinition}.
    - If {type} is Non-Null and {defaultValue} does not exist:
      - Let {argumentName} be the name of {argumentDefinition}.
      - Let {argument} be the argument in {arguments} named {argumentName}.
      - {argument} must exist.
      - Let {value} be the value of {argument}.
      - {value} must not be the {null} literal.

**Explanatory Text**

Arguments can be required. An argument is required if the argument type is
non-null and does not have a default value. Otherwise, the argument is optional.

For example the following are valid:

```graphql example
fragment goodBooleanArg on Arguments {
  booleanArgField(booleanArg: true)
}

fragment goodNonNullArg on Arguments {
  nonNullBooleanArgField(nonNullBooleanArg: true)
}
```

The argument can be omitted from a field with a nullable argument.

Therefore the following fragment is valid:

```graphql example
fragment goodBooleanArgDefault on Arguments {
  booleanArgField
}
```

but this is not valid on a required argument.

```graphql counter-example
fragment missingRequiredArg on Arguments {
  nonNullBooleanArgField
}
```

Providing the explicit value {null} is also not valid since required arguments
always have a non-null type.

```graphql counter-example
fragment missingRequiredArg on Arguments {
  nonNullBooleanArgField(nonNullBooleanArg: null)
}
```

## Fragments

### Fragment Declarations

#### Fragment Name Uniqueness

**Formal Specification**

- For each fragment definition {fragment} in the document:
  - Let {fragmentName} be the name of {fragment}.
  - Let {fragments} be all fragment definitions in the document named
    {fragmentName}.
  - {fragments} must be a set of one.

**Explanatory Text**

Fragment definitions are referenced in fragment spreads by name. To avoid
ambiguity, each fragment's name must be unique within a document.

Inline fragments are not considered fragment definitions, and are unaffected by
this validation rule.

For example the following document is valid:

```graphql example
{
  dog {
    ...fragmentOne
    ...fragmentTwo
  }
}

fragment fragmentOne on Dog {
  name
}

fragment fragmentTwo on Dog {
  owner {
    name
  }
}
```

While this document is invalid:

```graphql counter-example
{
  dog {
    ...fragmentOne
  }
}

fragment fragmentOne on Dog {
  name
}

fragment fragmentOne on Dog {
  owner {
    name
  }
}
```

#### Fragment Spread Type Existence

**Formal Specification**

- For each named spread {namedSpread} in the document:
  - Let {fragment} be the target of {namedSpread}.
  - The target type of {fragment} must be defined in the schema.

**Explanatory Text**

Fragments must be specified on types that exist in the schema. This applies for
both named and inline fragments. If they are not defined in the schema, the
fragment is invalid.

For example the following fragments are valid:

```graphql example
fragment correctType on Dog {
  name
}

fragment inlineFragment on Dog {
  ... on Dog {
    name
  }
}

fragment inlineFragment2 on Dog {
  ... @include(if: true) {
    name
  }
}
```

and the following do not validate:

```graphql counter-example
fragment notOnExistingType on NotInSchema {
  name
}

fragment inlineNotExistingType on Dog {
  ... on NotInSchema {
    name
  }
}
```

#### Fragments on Composite Types

**Formal Specification**

- For each {fragment} defined in the document:
  - The target type of fragment must have kind {UNION}, {INTERFACE}, or
    {OBJECT}.

**Explanatory Text**

Fragments can only be declared on unions, interfaces, and objects. They are
invalid on scalars. They can only be applied on non-leaf fields. This rule
applies to both inline and named fragments.

The following fragment declarations are valid:

```graphql example
fragment fragOnObject on Dog {
  name
}

fragment fragOnInterface on Pet {
  name
}

fragment fragOnUnion on CatOrDog {
  ... on Dog {
    name
  }
}
```

and the following are invalid:

```graphql counter-example
fragment fragOnScalar on Int {
  something
}

fragment inlineFragOnScalar on Dog {
  ... on Boolean {
    somethingElse
  }
}
```

#### Fragments Must Be Used

**Formal Specification**

- For each {fragment} defined in the document:
  - {fragment} must be the target of at least one spread in the document.

**Explanatory Text**

Defined fragments must be used within a document.

For example the following is an invalid document:

```raw graphql counter-example
fragment nameFragment on Dog { # unused
  name
}

{
  dog {
    name
  }
}
```

### Fragment Spreads

Field selection is also determined by spreading fragments into one another. The
selection set of the target fragment is combined into the selection set at the
level at which the target fragment is referenced.

#### Fragment Spread Target Defined

**Formal Specification**

- For every {namedSpread} in the document:
  - Let {fragment} be the target of {namedSpread}.
  - {fragment} must be defined in the document.

**Explanatory Text**

Named fragment spreads must refer to fragments defined within the document. It
is a validation error if the target of a spread is not defined.

```graphql counter-example
{
  dog {
    ...undefinedFragment
  }
}
```

#### Fragment Spreads Must Not Form Cycles

**Formal Specification**

- For each {fragmentDefinition} in the document:
  - Let {visited} be the empty set.
  - {DetectFragmentCycles(fragmentDefinition, visited)}

DetectFragmentCycles(fragmentDefinition, visited):

- Let {spreads} be all fragment spread descendants of {fragmentDefinition}.
- For each {spread} in {spreads}:
  - {visited} must not contain {spread}.
  - Let {nextVisited} be the set including {spread} and members of {visited}.
  - Let {nextFragmentDefinition} be the target of {spread}.
  - {DetectFragmentCycles(nextFragmentDefinition, nextVisited)}

**Explanatory Text**

The graph of fragment spreads must not form any cycles including spreading
itself. Otherwise an operation could infinitely spread or infinitely execute on
cycles in the underlying data.

This invalidates fragments that would result in an infinite spread:

```graphql counter-example
{
  dog {
    ...nameFragment
  }
}

fragment nameFragment on Dog {
  name
  ...barkVolumeFragment
}

fragment barkVolumeFragment on Dog {
  barkVolume
  ...nameFragment
}
```

If the above fragments were inlined, this would result in the infinitely large:

```graphql example
{
  dog {
    name
    barkVolume
    name
    barkVolume
    name
    barkVolume
    name
    # forever...
  }
}
```

This also invalidates fragments that would result in an infinite recursion when
executed against cyclic data:

```graphql counter-example
{
  dog {
    ...dogFragment
  }
}

fragment dogFragment on Dog {
  name
  owner {
    ...ownerFragment
  }
}

fragment ownerFragment on Human {
  name
  pets {
    ...dogFragment
  }
}
```

#### Fragment Spread Is Possible

**Formal Specification**

- For each {spread} (named or inline) defined in the document:
  - Let {fragment} be the target of {spread}.
  - Let {fragmentType} be the type condition of {fragment}.
  - Let {parentType} be the type of the selection set containing {spread}.
  - Let {applicableTypes} be the intersection of
    {GetPossibleTypes(fragmentType)} and {GetPossibleTypes(parentType)}.
  - {applicableTypes} must not be empty.

GetPossibleTypes(type):

- If {type} is an object type, return a set containing {type}.
- If {type} is an interface type, return the set of types implementing {type}.
- If {type} is a union type, return the set of possible types of {type}.

**Explanatory Text**

Fragments are declared on a type and will only apply when the runtime object
type matches the type condition. They also are spread within the context of a
parent type. A fragment spread is only valid if its type condition could ever
apply within the parent type.

##### Object Spreads in Object Scope

In the scope of an object type, the only valid object type fragment spread is
one that applies to the same type that is in scope.

For example

```graphql example
fragment dogFragment on Dog {
  ... on Dog {
    barkVolume
  }
}
```

and the following is invalid

```graphql counter-example
fragment catInDogFragmentInvalid on Dog {
  ... on Cat {
    meowVolume
  }
}
```

##### Abstract Spreads in Object Scope

In scope of an object type, unions or interface spreads can be used if the
object type implements the interface or is a member of the union.

For example

```graphql example
fragment petNameFragment on Pet {
  name
}

fragment interfaceWithinObjectFragment on Dog {
  ...petNameFragment
}
```

is valid because {Dog} implements Pet.

Likewise

```graphql example
fragment catOrDogNameFragment on CatOrDog {
  ... on Cat {
    meowVolume
  }
}

fragment unionWithObjectFragment on Dog {
  ...catOrDogNameFragment
}
```

is valid because {Dog} is a member of the {CatOrDog} union. It is worth noting
that if one inspected the contents of the {CatOrDogNameFragment} you could note
that no valid results would ever be returned. However we do not specify this as
invalid because we only consider the fragment declaration, not its body.

##### Object Spreads in Abstract Scope

Union or interface spreads can be used within the context of an object type
fragment, but only if the object type is one of the possible types of that
interface or union.

For example, the following fragments are valid:

```graphql example
fragment petFragment on Pet {
  name
  ... on Dog {
    barkVolume
  }
}

fragment catOrDogFragment on CatOrDog {
  ... on Cat {
    meowVolume
  }
}
```

{petFragment} is valid because {Dog} implements the interface {Pet}.
{catOrDogFragment} is valid because {Cat} is a member of the {CatOrDog} union.

By contrast the following fragments are invalid:

```graphql counter-example
fragment sentientFragment on Sentient {
  ... on Dog {
    barkVolume
  }
}

fragment humanOrAlienFragment on HumanOrAlien {
  ... on Cat {
    meowVolume
  }
}
```

{Dog} does not implement the interface {Sentient} and therefore
{sentientFragment} can never return meaningful results. Therefore the fragment
is invalid. Likewise {Cat} is not a member of the union {HumanOrAlien}, and it
can also never return meaningful results, making it invalid.

##### Abstract Spreads in Abstract Scope

Union or interfaces fragments can be used within each other. As long as there
exists at least _one_ object type that exists in the intersection of the
possible types of the scope and the spread, the spread is considered valid.

So for example

```graphql example
fragment unionWithInterface on Pet {
  ...dogOrHumanFragment
}

fragment dogOrHumanFragment on DogOrHuman {
  ... on Dog {
    barkVolume
  }
}
```

is considered valid because {Dog} implements interface {Pet} and is a member of
{DogOrHuman}.

However

```graphql counter-example
fragment nonIntersectingInterfaces on Pet {
  ...sentientFragment
}

fragment sentientFragment on Sentient {
  name
}
```

is not valid because there exists no type that implements both {Pet} and
{Sentient}.

**Interface Spreads in Implemented Interface Scope**

Additionally, an interface type fragment can always be spread into an interface
scope which it implements.

In the example below, the `...resourceFragment` fragments spreads is valid,
since `Resource` implements `Node`.

```raw graphql example
interface Node {
  id: ID!
}

interface Resource implements Node {
  id: ID!
  url: String
}

fragment interfaceWithInterface on Node {
  ...resourceFragment
}

fragment resourceFragment on Resource {
  url
}
```

## Values

### Values of Correct Type

**Formal Specification**

- For each input Value {value} in the document:
  - Let {type} be the type expected in the position {value} is found.
  - {value} must be coercible to {type}.

**Explanatory Text**

Literal values must be compatible with the type expected in the position they
are found as per the coercion rules defined in the Type System chapter.

The type expected in a position includes the type defined by the argument a
value is provided for, the type defined by an input object field a value is
provided for, and the type of a variable definition a default value is provided
for.

The following examples are valid use of value literals:

```graphql example
fragment goodBooleanArg on Arguments {
  booleanArgField(booleanArg: true)
}

fragment coercedIntIntoFloatArg on Arguments {
  # Note: The input coercion rules for Float allow Int literals.
  floatArgField(floatArg: 123)
}

query goodComplexDefaultValue($search: FindDogInput = { name: "Fido" }) {
  findDog(searchBy: $search) {
    name
  }
}
```

Non-coercible values (such as a String into an Int) are invalid. The following
examples are invalid:

```graphql counter-example
fragment stringIntoInt on Arguments {
  intArgField(intArg: "123")
}

query badComplexValue {
  findDog(searchBy: { name: 123 }) {
    name
  }
}
```

### Input Object Field Names

**Formal Specification**

- For each Input Object Field {inputField} in the document:
  - Let {inputFieldName} be the Name of {inputField}.
  - Let {inputFieldDefinition} be the input field definition provided by the
    parent input object type named {inputFieldName}.
  - {inputFieldDefinition} must exist.

**Explanatory Text**

Every input field provided in an input object value must be defined in the set
of possible fields of that input object's expected type.

For example the following example input object is valid:

```graphql example
{
  findDog(searchBy: { name: "Fido" }) {
    name
  }
}
```

While the following example input-object uses a field "favoriteCookieFlavor"
which is not defined on the expected type:

```graphql counter-example
{
  findDog(searchBy: { favoriteCookieFlavor: "Bacon" }) {
    name
  }
}
```

### Input Object Field Uniqueness

**Formal Specification**

- For each input object value {inputObject} in the document:
  - For every {inputField} in {inputObject}:
    - Let {name} be the Name of {inputField}.
    - Let {fields} be all Input Object Fields named {name} in {inputObject}.
    - {fields} must be the set containing only {inputField}.

**Explanatory Text**

Input objects must not contain more than one field of the same name, otherwise
an ambiguity would exist which includes an ignored portion of syntax.

For example the following document will not pass validation.

```graphql counter-example
{
  field(arg: { field: true, field: false })
}
```

### Input Object Required Fields

**Formal Specification**

- For each Input Object in the document:
  - Let {fields} be the fields provided by that Input Object.
  - Let {fieldDefinitions} be the set of input field definitions of that Input
    Object.
  - For each {fieldDefinition} in {fieldDefinitions}:
    - Let {type} be the expected type of {fieldDefinition}.
    - Let {defaultValue} be the default value of {fieldDefinition}.
    - If {type} is Non-Null and {defaultValue} does not exist:
      - Let {fieldName} be the name of {fieldDefinition}.
      - Let {field} be the input field in {fields} named {fieldName}.
      - {field} must exist.
      - Let {value} be the value of {field}.
      - {value} must not be the {null} literal.

**Explanatory Text**

Input object fields may be required. Much like a field may have required
arguments, an input object may have required fields. An input field is required
if it has a non-null type and does not have a default value. Otherwise, the
input object field is optional.

## Directives

### Directives Are Defined

**Formal Specification**

- For every {directive} in a document:
  - Let {directiveName} be the name of {directive}.
  - Let {directiveDefinition} be the directive named {directiveName}.
  - {directiveDefinition} must exist.

**Explanatory Text**

GraphQL services define what directives they support. For each usage of a
directive, the directive must be available on that service.

### Directives Are in Valid Locations

**Formal Specification**

- For every {directive} in a document:
  - Let {directiveName} be the name of {directive}.
  - Let {directiveDefinition} be the directive named {directiveName}.
  - Let {locations} be the valid locations for {directiveDefinition}.
  - Let {adjacent} be the AST node the directive affects.
  - {adjacent} must be represented by an item within {locations}.

**Explanatory Text**

GraphQL services define what directives they support and where they support
them. For each usage of a directive, the directive must be used in a location
that the service has declared support for.

For example the following document will not pass validation because `@skip` does
not provide `QUERY` as a valid location.

```graphql counter-example
query @skip(if: $foo) {
  field
}
```

### Directives Are Unique per Location

**Formal Specification**

- For every {location} in the document for which Directives can apply:
  - Let {directives} be the set of Directives which apply to {location} and are
    not repeatable.
  - For each {directive} in {directives}:
    - Let {directiveName} be the name of {directive}.
    - Let {namedDirectives} be the set of all Directives named {directiveName}
      in {directives}.
    - {namedDirectives} must be a set of one.

**Explanatory Text**

GraphQL allows directives that are defined as `repeatable` to be used more than
once on the definition they apply to, possibly with different arguments. In
contrast, if a directive is not `repeatable`, then only one occurrence of it is
allowed per location.

For example, the following document will not pass validation because
non-repeatable `@skip` has been used twice for the same field:

```raw graphql counter-example
query ($foo: Boolean = true, $bar: Boolean = false) {
  field @skip(if: $foo) @skip(if: $bar)
}
```

However the following example is valid because `@skip` has been used only once
per location, despite being used twice in the operation and on the same named
field:

```raw graphql example
query ($foo: Boolean = true, $bar: Boolean = false) {
  field @skip(if: $foo) {
    subfieldA
  }
  field @skip(if: $bar) {
    subfieldB
  }
}
```

## Variables

### Variable Uniqueness

**Formal Specification**

- For every {operation} in the document:
  - For every {variable} defined on {operation}:
    - Let {variableName} be the name of {variable}.
    - Let {variables} be the set of all variables named {variableName} on
      {operation}.
    - {variables} must be a set of one.

**Explanatory Text**

If any operation defines more than one variable with the same name, it is
ambiguous and invalid. It is invalid even if the type of the duplicate variable
is the same.

```graphql counter-example
query houseTrainedQuery($atOtherHomes: Boolean, $atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
  }
}
```

It is valid for multiple operations to define a variable with the same name. If
two operations reference the same fragment, it might actually be necessary:

```graphql example
query A($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  ...HouseTrainedFragment
}

query B($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  ...HouseTrainedFragment
}

fragment HouseTrainedFragment on Query {
  dog {
    isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
  }
}
```

### Variables Are Input Types

**Formal Specification**

- For every {operation} in a {document}:
  - For every {variable} on each {operation}:
    - Let {variableType} be the type of {variable}.
    - {IsInputType(variableType)} must be {true}.

**Explanatory Text**

Variables can only be input types. Objects, unions, and interfaces cannot be
used as inputs.

For these examples, consider the following type system additions:

```graphql example
extend type Query {
  booleanList(booleanListArg: [Boolean!]): Boolean
}
```

The following operations are valid:

```graphql example
query takesBoolean($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
  }
}

query takesComplexInput($search: FindDogInput) {
  findDog(searchBy: $search) {
    name
  }
}

query TakesListOfBooleanBang($booleans: [Boolean!]) {
  booleanList(booleanListArg: $booleans)
}
```

The following operations are invalid:

```graphql counter-example
query takesCat($cat: Cat) {
  # ...
}

query takesDogBang($dog: Dog!) {
  # ...
}

query takesListOfPet($pets: [Pet]) {
  # ...
}

query takesCatOrDog($catOrDog: CatOrDog) {
  # ...
}
```

### All Variable Uses Defined

**Formal Specification**

- For each {operation} in a document:
  - For each {variableUsage} in scope, variable must be in {operation}'s
    variable list.
  - Let {fragments} be every fragment referenced by that {operation}
    transitively.
  - For each {fragment} in {fragments}:
    - For each {variableUsage} in scope of {fragment}, variable must be in
      {operation}'s variable list.

**Explanatory Text**

Variables are scoped on a per-operation basis. That means that any variable used
within the context of an operation must be defined at the top level of that
operation

For example:

```graphql example
query variableIsDefined($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
  }
}
```

is valid. ${atOtherHomes} is defined by the operation.

By contrast the following document is invalid:

```graphql counter-example
query variableIsNotDefined {
  dog {
    isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
  }
}
```

${atOtherHomes} is not defined by the operation.

Fragments complicate this rule. Any fragment transitively included by an
operation has access to the variables defined by that operation. Fragments can
appear within multiple operations and therefore variable usages must correspond
to variable definitions in all of those operations.

For example the following is valid:

```graphql example
query variableIsDefinedUsedInSingleFragment($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

fragment isHouseTrainedFragment on Dog {
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
}
```

since {isHouseTrainedFragment} is used within the context of the operation
{variableIsDefinedUsedInSingleFragment} and the variable is defined by that
operation.

On the other hand, if a fragment is included within an operation that does not
define a referenced variable, the document is invalid.

```graphql counter-example
query variableIsNotDefinedUsedInSingleFragment {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

fragment isHouseTrainedFragment on Dog {
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
}
```

This applies transitively as well, so the following also fails:

```graphql counter-example
query variableIsNotDefinedUsedInNestedFragment {
  dog {
    ...outerHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

fragment outerHouseTrainedFragment on Dog {
  ...isHouseTrainedFragment
}

fragment isHouseTrainedFragment on Dog {
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
}
```

Variables must be defined in all operations in which a fragment is used.

```graphql example
query houseTrainedQueryOne($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

query houseTrainedQueryTwo($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

fragment isHouseTrainedFragment on Dog {
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
}
```

However the following does not validate:

```graphql counter-example
query houseTrainedQueryOne($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

query houseTrainedQueryTwoNotDefined {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

fragment isHouseTrainedFragment on Dog {
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
}
```

This is because {houseTrainedQueryTwoNotDefined} does not define a variable
${atOtherHomes} but that variable is used by {isHouseTrainedFragment} which is
included in that operation.

### All Variables Used

**Formal Specification**

- For every {operation} in the document:
  - Let {variables} be the variables defined by that {operation}.
  - Each {variable} in {variables} must be used at least once in either the
    operation scope itself or any fragment transitively referenced by that
    operation.

**Explanatory Text**

All variables defined by an operation must be used in that operation or a
fragment transitively included by that operation. Unused variables cause a
validation error.

For example the following is invalid:

```graphql counter-example
query variableUnused($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    isHouseTrained
  }
}
```

because ${atOtherHomes} is not referenced.

These rules apply to transitive fragment spreads as well:

```graphql example
query variableUsedInFragment($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

fragment isHouseTrainedFragment on Dog {
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
}
```

The above is valid since ${atOtherHomes} is used in {isHouseTrainedFragment}
which is included by {variableUsedInFragment}.

If that fragment did not have a reference to ${atOtherHomes} it would be not
valid:

```graphql counter-example
query variableNotUsedWithinFragment($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedWithoutVariableFragment
  }
}

fragment isHouseTrainedWithoutVariableFragment on Dog {
  isHouseTrained
}
```

All operations in a document must use all of their variables.

As a result, the following document does not validate.

```graphql counter-example
query queryWithUsedVar($atOtherHomes: Boolean) {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

query queryWithExtraVar($atOtherHomes: Boolean, $extra: Int) {
  dog {
    ...isHouseTrainedFragment
  }
}

fragment isHouseTrainedFragment on Dog {
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: $atOtherHomes)
}
```

This document is not valid because {queryWithExtraVar} defines an extraneous
variable.

### All Variable Usages Are Allowed

**Formal Specification**

- For each {operation} in {document}:
  - Let {variableUsages} be all usages transitively included in the {operation}.
  - For each {variableUsage} in {variableUsages}:
    - Let {variableName} be the name of {variableUsage}.
    - Let {variableDefinition} be the {VariableDefinition} named {variableName}
      defined within {operation}.
    - {IsVariableUsageAllowed(variableDefinition, variableUsage)} must be
      {true}.

IsVariableUsageAllowed(variableDefinition, variableUsage):

- Let {variableType} be the expected type of {variableDefinition}.
- Let {locationType} be the expected type of the {Argument}, {ObjectField}, or
  {ListValue} entry where {variableUsage} is located.
- If {locationType} is a non-null type AND {variableType} is NOT a non-null
  type:
  - Let {hasNonNullVariableDefaultValue} be {true} if a default value exists for
    {variableDefinition} and is not the value {null}.
  - Let {hasLocationDefaultValue} be {true} if a default value exists for the
    {Argument} or {ObjectField} where {variableUsage} is located.
  - If {hasNonNullVariableDefaultValue} is NOT {true} AND
    {hasLocationDefaultValue} is NOT {true}, return {false}.
  - Let {nullableLocationType} be the unwrapped nullable type of {locationType}.
  - Return {AreTypesCompatible(variableType, nullableLocationType)}.
- Return {AreTypesCompatible(variableType, locationType)}.

AreTypesCompatible(variableType, locationType):

- If {locationType} is a non-null type:
  - If {variableType} is NOT a non-null type, return {false}.
  - Let {nullableLocationType} be the unwrapped nullable type of {locationType}.
  - Let {nullableVariableType} be the unwrapped nullable type of {variableType}.
  - Return {AreTypesCompatible(nullableVariableType, nullableLocationType)}.
- Otherwise, if {variableType} is a non-null type:
  - Let {nullableVariableType} be the nullable type of {variableType}.
  - Return {AreTypesCompatible(nullableVariableType, locationType)}.
- Otherwise, if {locationType} is a list type:
  - If {variableType} is NOT a list type, return {false}.
  - Let {itemLocationType} be the unwrapped item type of {locationType}.
  - Let {itemVariableType} be the unwrapped item type of {variableType}.
  - Return {AreTypesCompatible(itemVariableType, itemLocationType)}.
- Otherwise, if {variableType} is a list type, return {false}.
- Return {true} if {variableType} and {locationType} are identical, otherwise
  {false}.

**Explanatory Text**

Variable usages must be compatible with the arguments they are passed to.

Validation failures occur when variables are used in the context of types that
are complete mismatches, or if a nullable type in a variable is passed to a
non-null argument type.

Types must match:

```graphql counter-example
query intCannotGoIntoBoolean($intArg: Int) {
  arguments {
    booleanArgField(booleanArg: $intArg)
  }
}
```

${intArg} typed as {Int} cannot be used as an argument to {booleanArg}, typed as
{Boolean}.

List cardinality must also be the same. For example, lists cannot be passed into
singular values.

```graphql counter-example
query booleanListCannotGoIntoBoolean($booleanListArg: [Boolean]) {
  arguments {
    booleanArgField(booleanArg: $booleanListArg)
  }
}
```

Nullability must also be respected. In general a nullable variable cannot be
passed to a non-null argument.

```graphql counter-example
query booleanArgQuery($booleanArg: Boolean) {
  arguments {
    nonNullBooleanArgField(nonNullBooleanArg: $booleanArg)
  }
}
```

For list types, the same rules around nullability apply to both outer types and
inner types. A nullable list cannot be passed to a non-null list, and a list of
nullable values cannot be passed to a list of non-null values. The following is
valid:

```graphql example
query nonNullListToList($nonNullBooleanList: [Boolean]!) {
  arguments {
    booleanListArgField(booleanListArg: $nonNullBooleanList)
  }
}
```

However, a nullable list cannot be passed to a non-null list:

```graphql counter-example
query listToNonNullList($booleanList: [Boolean]) {
  arguments {
    nonNullBooleanListField(nonNullBooleanListArg: $booleanList)
  }
}
```

This would fail validation because a `[T]` cannot be passed to a `[T]!`.
Similarly a `[T]` cannot be passed to a `[T!]`.

**Allowing Optional Variables When Default Values Exist**

A notable exception to typical variable type compatibility is allowing a
variable definition with a nullable type to be provided to a non-null location
as long as either that variable or that location provides a default value.

In the example below, an optional variable `$booleanArg` is allowed to be used
in the non-null argument `optionalBooleanArg` because the field argument is
optional since it provides a default value in the schema.

```graphql example
query booleanArgQueryWithDefault($booleanArg: Boolean) {
  arguments {
    optionalNonNullBooleanArgField(optionalBooleanArg: $booleanArg)
  }
}
```

In the example below, an optional variable `$booleanArg` is allowed to be used
in the non-null argument (`nonNullBooleanArg`) because the variable provides a
default value in the operation. This behavior is explicitly supported for
compatibility with earlier editions of this specification. GraphQL authoring
tools may wish to report this as a warning with the suggestion to replace
`Boolean` with `Boolean!` to avoid ambiguity.

```graphql example
query booleanArgQueryWithDefault($booleanArg: Boolean = true) {
  arguments {
    nonNullBooleanArgField(nonNullBooleanArg: $booleanArg)
  }
}
```

Note: The value {null} could still be provided to such a variable at runtime. A
non-null argument must raise a _field error_ if provided a {null} value.
