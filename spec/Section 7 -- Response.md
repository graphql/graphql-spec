# Response

When a GraphQL service receives a _request_, it must return a well-formed
response. The service's response describes the result of executing the requested
operation if successful, and describes any errors raised during the request.

A response may contain both a partial response as well as a list of errors in
the case that any _execution error_ was raised and replaced with {null}.

## Response Format

:: A GraphQL request returns a _response_. A _response_ is either an _execution
result_, a _response stream_, or a _request error result_.

### Execution Result

:: A GraphQL request returns an _execution result_ when the GraphQL operation is
a query or mutation and the request included execution. Additionally, for each
event in a subscription's _source stream_, the _response stream_ will emit an
_execution result_.

An _execution result_ must be map.

The _execution result_ must contain an entry with key {"data"}. The value of
this entry is described in the "Data" section.

If execution raised any errors, the _execution result_ must contain an entry
with key {"errors"}. The value of this entry must be a non-empty list of
_execution error_ raised during execution. Each error must be a map as described
in the "Errors" section below. If the request completed without raising any
errors, this entry must not be present.

Note: When {"errors"} is present in a _execution result_, it may be helpful for
it to appear first when serialized to make it more apparent that errors are
present.

The _execution result_ may also contain an entry with key `extensions`. The
value of this entry is described in the "Extensions" section.

### Response Stream

:: A GraphQL request returns a _response stream_ when the GraphQL operation is a
subscription and the request included execution. A response stream must be a
stream of _execution result_.

### Request Error Result

:: A GraphQL request returns a _request error result_ when one or more _request
error_ are raised, causing the request to fail before execution. This request
will result in no response data.

Note: A _request error_ may be raised before execution due to missing
information, syntax errors, validation failure, coercion failure, or any other
reason the implementation may determine should prevent the request from
proceeding.

A _request error result_ must be a map.

The _request error result_ map must contain an entry with key {"errors"}. The
value of this entry must be a non-empty list of _request error_ raised during
the _request_. It must contain at least one _request error_ indicating why no
data was able to be returned. Each error must be a map as described in the
"Errors" section below.

Note: It may be helpful for the {"errors"} key to appear first when serialized
to make it more apparent that errors are present.

The _request error result_ map must not contain an entry with key {"data"}.

The _request error result_ map may also contain an entry with key `extensions`.
The value of this entry is described in the "Extensions" section.

### Response Position

<a name="sec-Path">
  <!-- Legacy link, this section was previously titled "Path" -->
</a>

:: A _response position_ is a uniquely identifiable position in the response
data produced during execution. It is either a direct entry in the {resultMap}
of a {ExecuteSelectionSet()}, or it is a position in a (potentially nested) List
value. Each response position is uniquely identifiable via a _response path_.

:: A _response path_ uniquely identifies a _response position_ via a list of
path segments (response names or list indices) starting at the root of the
response and ending with the associated response position.

The value for a _response path_ must be a list of path segments. Path segments
that represent field _response name_ must be strings, and path segments that
represent list indices must be 0-indexed integers. If a path segment is
associated with an aliased field it must use the aliased name, since it
represents a path in the response, not in the request.

When a _response path_ is present on an _error result_, it identifies the
_response position_ which raised the error.

A single field execution may result in multiple response positions. For example,

```graphql example
{
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The hero's name would be found in the _response position_ identified by the
_response path_ `["hero", "name"]`. The List of the hero's friends would be
found at `["hero", "friends"]`, the hero's first friend at
`["hero", "friends", 0]` and that friend's name at
`["hero", "friends", 0, "name"]`.

### Data

The {"data"} entry in the _execution result_ will be the result of the execution
of the requested operation. If the operation was a query, this output will be an
object of the query root operation type; if the operation was a mutation, this
output will be an object of the mutation root operation type.

The response data is the result of accumulating the resolved result of all
response positions during execution.

If an error was raised before execution begins, the _response_ must be a
_request error result_ which will result in no response data.

If an error was raised during the execution that prevented a valid response, the
{"data"} entry in the response should be `null`.

### Errors

The {"errors"} entry in the _execution result_ or _request error result_ is a
non-empty list of errors raised during the _request_, where each error is a map
of data described by the error result format below.

**Request Errors**

:: A _request error_ is an error raised during a _request_ which results in no
response data. Typically raised before execution begins, a request error may
occur due to a parse grammar or validation error in the _Document_, an inability
to determine which operation to execute, or invalid input values for variables.

A request error is typically the fault of the requesting client.

If a request error is raised, the _response_ must be a _request error result_.
The {"data"} entry in this map must not be present, the {"errors"} entry must
include the error, and request execution should be halted.

**Execution Errors**

<a name="sec-Errors.Field-Errors">
  <!-- Legacy link, this section was previously titled "Field Errors" -->
</a>

:: An _execution error_ is an error raised during the execution of a particular
field which results in partial response data. This may occur due to failure to
coerce the arguments for the field, an internal error during value resolution,
or failure to coerce the resulting value.

Note: In previous versions of this specification _execution error_ was called
_field error_.

An execution error is typically the fault of a GraphQL service.

An _execution error_ must occur at a specific _response position_, and may occur
in any response position. The response position of an execution error is
indicated via a _response path_ in the error response's {"path"} entry.

When an execution error is raised at a given _response position_, then that
response position must not be present within the _response_ {"data"} entry
(except {null}), and the {"errors"} entry must include the error. Nested
execution is halted and sibling execution attempts to continue, producing
partial result (see
[Handling Execution Errors](#sec-Handling-Execution-Errors)).

**Error Result Format**

Every error must contain an entry with the key {"message"} with a string
description of the error intended for the developer as a guide to understand and
correct the error.

If an error can be associated to a particular point in the requested GraphQL
document, it should contain an entry with the key {"locations"} with a list of
locations, where each location is a map with the keys {"line"} and {"column"},
both positive numbers starting from `1` which describe the beginning of an
associated syntax element.

If an error can be associated to a particular field in the GraphQL result, it
must contain an entry with the key {"path"} with a _response path_ which
describes the _response position_ which raised the error. This allows clients to
identify whether a {null} resolved result is a true value or the result of an
_execution error_.

For example, if fetching one of the friends' names fails in the following
operation:

```graphql example
{
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    heroFriends: friends {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The response might look like:

```json example
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Name for character with ID 1002 could not be fetched.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 6, "column": 7 }],
      "path": ["hero", "heroFriends", 1, "name"]
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "hero": {
      "name": "R2-D2",
      "heroFriends": [
        {
          "id": "1000",
          "name": "Luke Skywalker"
        },
        {
          "id": "1002",
          "name": null
        },
        {
          "id": "1003",
          "name": "Leia Organa"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If the field which experienced an error was declared as `Non-Null`, the `null`
result will bubble up to the next nullable field. In that case, the `path` for
the error should include the full path to the result field where the error was
raised, even if that field is not present in the response.

For example, if the `name` field from above had declared a `Non-Null` return
type in the schema, the result would look different but the error reported would
be the same:

```json example
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Name for character with ID 1002 could not be fetched.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 6, "column": 7 }],
      "path": ["hero", "heroFriends", 1, "name"]
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "hero": {
      "name": "R2-D2",
      "heroFriends": [
        {
          "id": "1000",
          "name": "Luke Skywalker"
        },
        null,
        {
          "id": "1003",
          "name": "Leia Organa"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL services may provide an additional entry to errors with key
`extensions`. This entry, if set, must have a map as its value. This entry is
reserved for implementers to add additional information to errors however they
see fit, and there are no additional restrictions on its contents.

```json example
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Name for character with ID 1002 could not be fetched.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 6, "column": 7 }],
      "path": ["hero", "heroFriends", 1, "name"],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "CAN_NOT_FETCH_BY_ID",
        "timestamp": "Fri Feb 9 14:33:09 UTC 2018"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

GraphQL services should not provide any additional entries to the error format
since they could conflict with additional entries that may be added in future
versions of this specification.

Note: Previous versions of this spec did not describe the `extensions` entry for
error formatting. While non-specified entries are not violations, they are still
discouraged.

```json counter-example
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Name for character with ID 1002 could not be fetched.",
      "locations": [{ "line": 6, "column": 7 }],
      "path": ["hero", "heroFriends", 1, "name"],
      "code": "CAN_NOT_FETCH_BY_ID",
      "timestamp": "Fri Feb 9 14:33:09 UTC 2018"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Extensions

The {"extensions"} entry in an _execution result_ or _request error result_, if
set, must have a map as its value. This entry is reserved for implementers to
extend the protocol however they see fit, and hence there are no additional
restrictions on its contents.

### Additional Entries

To ensure future changes to the protocol do not break existing services and
clients, the _execution result_ and _request error result_ maps must not contain
any entries other than those described above. Clients must ignore any entries
other than those described above.

## Serialization Format

GraphQL does not require a specific serialization format. However, clients
should use a serialization format that supports the major primitives in the
GraphQL response. In particular, the serialization format must at least support
representations of the following four primitives:

- Map
- List
- String
- Null

A serialization format should also support the following primitives, each
representing one of the common GraphQL scalar types, however a string or simpler
primitive may be used as a substitute if any are not directly supported:

- Boolean
- Int
- Float
- Enum Value

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of what a serialization format may
encode. For example custom scalars representing a Date, Time, URI, or number
with a different precision may be represented in whichever relevant format a
given serialization format may support.

### JSON Serialization

JSON is the most common serialization format for GraphQL. Though as mentioned
above, GraphQL does not require a specific serialization format.

When using JSON as a serialization of GraphQL responses, the following JSON
values should be used to encode the related GraphQL values:

| GraphQL Value | JSON Value        |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Map           | Object            |
| List          | Array             |
| Null          | {null}            |
| String        | String            |
| Boolean       | {true} or {false} |
| Int           | Number            |
| Float         | Number            |
| Enum Value    | String            |

Note: For consistency and ease of notation, examples of responses are given in
JSON format throughout this document.

### Serialized Map Ordering

Since the result of evaluating a _selection set_ is ordered, the serialized Map
of results should preserve this order by writing the map entries in the same
order as those fields were requested as defined by selection set execution.
Producing a serialized response where fields are represented in the same order
in which they appear in the request improves human readability during debugging
and enables more efficient parsing of responses if the order of properties can
be anticipated.

Serialization formats which represent an ordered map should preserve the order
of requested fields as defined by {CollectFields()} in the Execution section.
Serialization formats which only represent unordered maps but where order is
still implicit in the serialization's textual order (such as JSON) should
preserve the order of requested fields textually.

For example, if the request was `{ name, age }`, a GraphQL service responding in
JSON should respond with `{ "name": "Mark", "age": 30 }` and should not respond
with `{ "age": 30, "name": "Mark" }`.

While JSON Objects are specified as an
[unordered collection of key-value pairs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-4)
the pairs are represented in an ordered manner. In other words, while the JSON
strings `{ "name": "Mark", "age": 30 }` and `{ "age": 30, "name": "Mark" }`
encode the same value, they also have observably different property orderings.

Note: This does not violate the JSON spec, as clients may still interpret
objects in the response as unordered Maps and arrive at a valid value.
