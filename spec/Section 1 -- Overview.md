# Overview

GraphQL is a query language designed to build client applications by providing
an intuitive and flexible syntax and system for describing their data
requirements and interactions.

For example, this GraphQL _request_ will receive the name of the user with id 4
from the Facebook implementation of GraphQL.

```graphql example
{
  user(id: 4) {
    name
  }
}
```

Which produces the resulting data (in JSON):

```json example
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Mark Zuckerberg"
  }
}
```

GraphQL is not a programming language capable of arbitrary computation, but is
instead a language used to make requests to application services that have
capabilities defined in this specification. GraphQL does not mandate a
particular programming language or storage system for application services that
implement it. Instead, application services take their capabilities and map them
to a uniform language, type system, and philosophy that GraphQL encodes. This
provides a unified interface friendly to product development and a powerful
platform for tool-building.

GraphQL has a number of design principles:

- **Product-centric**: GraphQL is unapologetically driven by the requirements of
  views and the front-end engineers that write them. GraphQL starts with their
  way of thinking and requirements and builds the language and runtime necessary
  to enable that.

- **Hierarchical**: Most product development today involves the creation and
  manipulation of view hierarchies. To achieve congruence with the structure of
  these applications, a GraphQL request itself is structured hierarchically. The
  request is shaped just like the data in its response. It is a natural way for
  clients to describe data requirements.

- **Strong-typing**: Every GraphQL service defines an application-specific type
  system. Requests are executed within the context of that type system. Given a
  GraphQL operation, tools can ensure that it is both syntactically correct and
  valid within that type system before execution, i.e. at development time, and
  the service can make certain guarantees about the shape and nature of the
  response.

- **Client-specified response**: Through its type system, a GraphQL service
  publishes the capabilities that its clients are allowed to consume. It is the
  client that is responsible for specifying exactly how it will consume those
  published capabilities. These requests are specified at field-level
  granularity. In the majority of client-server applications written without
  GraphQL, the service determines the shape of data returned from its various
  endpoints. A GraphQL response, on the other hand, contains exactly what a
  client asks for and no more.

- **Introspective**: GraphQL is introspective. A GraphQL service's type system
  can be queryable by the GraphQL language itself, as will be described in this
  specification. GraphQL introspection serves as a powerful platform for
  building common tools and client software libraries.

Because of these principles, GraphQL is a powerful and productive environment
for building client applications. Product developers and designers building
applications against working GraphQL services—supported with quality tools—can
quickly become productive without reading extensive documentation and with
little or no formal training. To enable that experience, there must be those
that build those services and tools.

The following formal specification serves as a reference for those builders. It
describes the language and its grammar, the type system and the introspection
system used to query it, and the execution and validation engines with the
algorithms to power them. The goal of this specification is to provide a
foundation and framework for an ecosystem of GraphQL tools, client libraries,
and service implementations—spanning both organizations and platforms—that has
yet to be built. We look forward to working with the community in order to do
that.
