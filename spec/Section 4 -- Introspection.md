# Introspection

A GraphQL service supports introspection over its schema. This schema is queried
using GraphQL itself, creating a powerful platform for tool-building.

Take an example request for a trivial app. In this case there is a User type
with three fields: id, name, and birthday.

For example, given a service with the following type definition:

```graphql example
type User {
  id: String
  name: String
  birthday: Date
}
```

A request containing the operation:

```graphql example
{
  __type(name: "User") {
    name
    fields {
      name
      type {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

would produce the result:

```json example
{
  "__type": {
    "name": "User",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "id",
        "type": { "name": "String" }
      },
      {
        "name": "name",
        "type": { "name": "String" }
      },
      {
        "name": "birthday",
        "type": { "name": "Date" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Reserved Names**

Types and fields required by the GraphQL introspection system that are used in
the same context as user-defined types and fields are prefixed with {"\_\_"} two
underscores. This in order to avoid naming collisions with user-defined GraphQL
types.

Otherwise, any {Name} within a GraphQL type system must not start with two
underscores {"\_\_"}.

## Type Name Introspection

GraphQL supports type name introspection within any selection set in an
operation, with the single exception of selections at the root of a subscription
operation. Type name introspection is accomplished via the meta-field
`__typename: String!` on any Object, Interface, or Union. It returns the name of
the concrete Object type at that point during execution.

This is most often used when querying against Interface or Union types to
identify which actual Object type of the possible types has been returned.

As a meta-field, `__typename` is implicit and does not appear in the fields list
in any defined type.

Note: `__typename` may not be included as a root field in a subscription
operation.

## Schema Introspection

The schema introspection system is accessible from the meta-fields `__schema`
and `__type` which are accessible from the type of the root of a query
operation.

```graphql
__schema: __Schema!
__type(name: String!): __Type
```

Like all meta-fields, these are implicit and do not appear in the fields list in
the root type of the query operation.

**First Class Documentation**

All types in the introspection system provide a `description` field of type
`String` to allow type designers to publish documentation in addition to
capabilities. A GraphQL service may return the `description` field using
Markdown syntax (as specified by [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)).
Therefore it is recommended that any tool that displays `description` use a
CommonMark-compliant Markdown renderer.

**Deprecation**

To support the management of backwards compatibility, GraphQL fields, arguments,
input fields, and enum values can indicate whether or not they are deprecated
(`isDeprecated: Boolean`) along with a description of why it is deprecated
(`deprecationReason: String`).

Tools built using GraphQL introspection should respect deprecation by
discouraging deprecated use through information hiding or developer-facing
warnings.

**Schema Introspection Schema**

The schema introspection system is itself represented as a GraphQL schema. Below
are the full set of type system definitions providing schema introspection,
which are fully defined in the sections below.

```graphql
type __Schema {
  description: String
  types: [__Type!]!
  queryType: __Type!
  mutationType: __Type
  subscriptionType: __Type
  directives: [__Directive!]!
}

type __Type {
  kind: __TypeKind!
  name: String
  description: String
  # must be non-null for OBJECT and INTERFACE, otherwise null.
  fields(includeDeprecated: Boolean = false): [__Field!]
  # must be non-null for OBJECT and INTERFACE, otherwise null.
  interfaces: [__Type!]
  # must be non-null for INTERFACE and UNION, otherwise null.
  possibleTypes: [__Type!]
  # must be non-null for ENUM, otherwise null.
  enumValues(includeDeprecated: Boolean = false): [__EnumValue!]
  # must be non-null for INPUT_OBJECT, otherwise null.
  inputFields(includeDeprecated: Boolean = false): [__InputValue!]
  # must be non-null for NON_NULL and LIST, otherwise null.
  ofType: __Type
  # may be non-null for custom SCALAR, otherwise null.
  specifiedByURL: String
}

enum __TypeKind {
  SCALAR
  OBJECT
  INTERFACE
  UNION
  ENUM
  INPUT_OBJECT
  LIST
  NON_NULL
}

type __Field {
  name: String!
  description: String
  args(includeDeprecated: Boolean = false): [__InputValue!]!
  type: __Type!
  isDeprecated: Boolean!
  deprecationReason: String
}

type __InputValue {
  name: String!
  description: String
  type: __Type!
  defaultValue: String
  isDeprecated: Boolean!
  deprecationReason: String
}

type __EnumValue {
  name: String!
  description: String
  isDeprecated: Boolean!
  deprecationReason: String
}

type __Directive {
  name: String!
  description: String
  locations: [__DirectiveLocation!]!
  args(includeDeprecated: Boolean = false): [__InputValue!]!
  isRepeatable: Boolean!
}

enum __DirectiveLocation {

}
```

### The \_\_Schema Type

The `__Schema` type is returned from the `__schema` meta-field and provides all
information about the schema of a GraphQL service.

Fields\:

- `description` may return a String or {null}.
- `queryType` is the root type of a query operation.
- `mutationType` is the root type of a mutation operation, if supported.
  Otherwise {null}.
- `subscriptionType` is the root type of a subscription operation, if supported.
  Otherwise {null}.
- `types` must return the set of all named types contained within this schema.
  Any named type which can be found through a field of any introspection type
  must be included in this set.
- `directives` must return the set of all directives available within this
  schema including all built-in directives.

### The \_\_Type Type

`__Type` is at the core of the type introspection system, it represents all
types in the system: both named types (e.g. Scalars and Object types) and type
modifiers (e.g. List and Non-Null types).

Type modifiers are used to modify the type presented in the field `ofType`. This
modified type may recursively be a modified type, representing lists,
non-nullables, and combinations thereof, ultimately modifying a named type.

There are several different kinds of type. In each kind, different fields are
actually valid. All possible kinds are listed in the `__TypeKind` enum.

Each sub-section below defines the expected fields of `__Type` given each
possible value of the `__TypeKind` enum:

- {"SCALAR"}
- {"OBJECT"}
- {"INTERFACE"}
- {"UNION"}
- {"ENUM"}
- {"INPUT_OBJECT"}
- {"LIST"}
- {"NON_NULL"}

**Scalar**

Represents scalar types such as Int, String, and Boolean. Scalars cannot have
fields.

Also represents [Custom scalars](#sec-Scalars.Custom-Scalars) which may provide
`specifiedByURL` as a _scalar specification URL_.

Fields\:

- `kind` must return `__TypeKind.SCALAR`.
- `name` must return a String.
- `description` may return a String or {null}.
- `specifiedByURL` may return a String (in the form of a URL) for custom
  scalars, otherwise must be {null}.
- All other fields must return {null}.

**Object**

Object types represent concrete instantiations of sets of fields. The
introspection types (e.g. `__Type`, `__Field`, etc) are examples of objects.

Fields\:

- `kind` must return `__TypeKind.OBJECT`.
- `name` must return a String.
- `description` may return a String or {null}.
- `fields` must return the set of fields that can be selected for this type.
  - Accepts the argument `includeDeprecated` which defaults to {false}. If
    {true}, deprecated fields are also returned.
- `interfaces` must return the set of interfaces that an object implements (if
  none, `interfaces` must return the empty set).
- All other fields must return {null}.

**Union**

Unions are an abstract type where no common fields are declared. The possible
types of a union are explicitly listed out in `possibleTypes`. Types can be made
parts of unions without modification of that type.

Fields\:

- `kind` must return `__TypeKind.UNION`.
- `name` must return a String.
- `description` may return a String or {null}.
- `possibleTypes` returns the list of types that can be represented within this
  union. They must be object types.
- All other fields must return {null}.

**Interface**

Interfaces are an abstract type where there are common fields declared. Any type
that implements an interface must define all the named fields where each
implementing field type is equal to or a sub-type of (covariant) the interface
type. The implementations of this interface are explicitly listed out in
`possibleTypes`.

Fields\:

- `kind` must return `__TypeKind.INTERFACE`.
- `name` must return a String.
- `description` may return a String or {null}.
- `fields` must return the set of fields required by this interface.
  - Accepts the argument `includeDeprecated` which defaults to {false}. If
    {true}, deprecated fields are also returned.
- `interfaces` must return the set of interfaces that an interface implements
  (if none, `interfaces` must return the empty set).
- `possibleTypes` returns the list of types that implement this interface. They
  must be object types.
- All other fields must return {null}.

**Enum**

Enums are special scalars that can only have a defined set of values.

Fields\:

- `kind` must return `__TypeKind.ENUM`.
- `name` must return a String.
- `description` may return a String or {null}.
- `enumValues` must return the set of enum values as a list of `__EnumValue`.
  There must be at least one and they must have unique names.
  - Accepts the argument `includeDeprecated` which defaults to {false}. If
    {true}, deprecated enum values are also returned.
- All other fields must return {null}.

**Input Object**

Input objects are composite types defined as a list of named input values. They
are only used as inputs to arguments and variables and cannot be a field return
type.

For example the input object `Point` could be defined as:

```graphql example
input Point {
  x: Int
  y: Int
}
```

Fields\:

- `kind` must return `__TypeKind.INPUT_OBJECT`.
- `name` must return a String.
- `description` may return a String or {null}.
- `inputFields` must return the set of input fields as a list of `__InputValue`.
  - Accepts the argument `includeDeprecated` which defaults to {false}. If
    {true}, deprecated input fields are also returned.
- All other fields must return {null}.

**List**

Lists represent sequences of values in GraphQL. A List type is a type modifier:
it wraps another type instance in the `ofType` field, which defines the type of
each item in the list.

The modified type in the `ofType` field may itself be a modified type, allowing
the representation of Lists of Lists, or Lists of Non-Nulls.

Fields\:

- `kind` must return `__TypeKind.LIST`.
- `ofType` must return a type of any kind.
- All other fields must return {null}.

**Non-Null**

GraphQL types are nullable. The value {null} is a valid response for field type.

A Non-Null type is a type modifier: it wraps another type instance in the
`ofType` field. Non-null types do not allow {null} as a response, and indicate
required inputs for arguments and input object fields.

The modified type in the `ofType` field may itself be a modified List type,
allowing the representation of Non-Null of Lists. However it must not be a
modified Non-Null type to avoid a redundant Non-Null of Non-Null.

Fields\:

- `kind` must return `__TypeKind.NON_NULL`.
- `ofType` must return a type of any kind except Non-Null.
- All other fields must return {null}.

### The \_\_Field Type

The `__Field` type represents each field in an Object or Interface type.

Fields\:

- `name` must return a String
- `description` may return a String or {null}
- `args` returns a List of `__InputValue` representing the arguments this field
  accepts.
  - Accepts the argument `includeDeprecated` which defaults to {false}. If
    {true}, deprecated arguments are also returned.
- `type` must return a `__Type` that represents the type of value returned by
  this field.
- `isDeprecated` returns {true} if this field should no longer be used,
  otherwise {false}.
- `deprecationReason` optionally provides a reason why this field is deprecated.

### The \_\_InputValue Type

The `__InputValue` type represents field and directive arguments as well as the
`inputFields` of an input object.

Fields\:

- `name` must return a String
- `description` may return a String or {null}
- `type` must return a `__Type` that represents the type this input value
  expects.
- `defaultValue` may return a String encoding (using the GraphQL language) of
  the default value used by this input value in the condition a value is not
  provided at runtime. If this input value has no default value, returns {null}.
- `isDeprecated` returns {true} if this input field or argument should no longer
  be used, otherwise {false}.
- `deprecationReason` optionally provides a reason why this input field or
  argument is deprecated.

### The \_\_EnumValue Type

The `__EnumValue` type represents one of possible values of an enum.

Fields\:

- `name` must return a String
- `description` may return a String or {null}
- `isDeprecated` returns {true} if this enum value should no longer be used,
  otherwise {false}.
- `deprecationReason` optionally provides a reason why this enum value is
  deprecated.

### The \_\_Directive Type

The `__Directive` type represents a directive that a service supports.

This includes both any _built-in directive_ and any _custom directive_.

Individual directives may only be used in locations that are explicitly
supported. All possible locations are listed in the `__DirectiveLocation` enum:

- {"QUERY"}
- {"MUTATION"}
- {"SUBSCRIPTION"}
- {"FIELD"}
- {"FRAGMENT_DEFINITION"}
- {"FRAGMENT_SPREAD"}
- {"INLINE_FRAGMENT"}
- {"VARIABLE_DEFINITION"}
- {"SCHEMA"}
- {"SCALAR"}
- {"OBJECT"}
- {"FIELD_DEFINITION"}
- {"ARGUMENT_DEFINITION"}
- {"INTERFACE"}
- {"UNION"}
- {"ENUM"}
- {"ENUM_VALUE"}
- {"INPUT_OBJECT"}
- {"INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION"}

Fields\:

- `name` must return a String
- `description` may return a String or {null}
- `locations` returns a List of `__DirectiveLocation` representing the valid
  locations this directive may be placed.
- `args` returns a List of `__InputValue` representing the arguments this
  directive accepts.
  - Accepts the argument `includeDeprecated` which defaults to {false}. If
    {true}, deprecated arguments are also returned.
- `isRepeatable` must return a Boolean that indicates if the directive may be
  used repeatedly at a single location.
