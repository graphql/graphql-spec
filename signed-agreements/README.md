# Legacy Signed Agreements

The signed agreement found in this directory was contributed when this
specification was licensed under OWFa 1.0 on September 26, 2017 by Facebook.

Since then the [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphql.org/foundation/) was formed
in 2019, at which point the GraphQL Specification Project became a
[Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org/) project.

The charter and legal documents currently governing this specification and other
GraphQL projects can be found in the
[GraphQL Foundation repository](https://github.com/graphql/foundation).
